Given a small set of seed instances for a particular relation, the system learns lexical patterns, applies them to extract new instances, and then uses the Web to filter and expand the instances. Preliminary experiments show that Espresso extracts highly precise lists of a wide variety of semantic relations when compared with two state of the art systems. In this paper we present Espresso, a novel bootstrapping algorithm for automatically harvesting semantic relations, aiming at effectively supporting NLP applications, emphasizing two major points that have been partially neglected by previous systems: generality and weak supervision. Manually building three lexico-syntactic patterns, Hearst sketched a bootstrapping algorithm to learn more patterns from instances, which has served as the model for most subsequent pattern-based algorithms. This study is the first extensive attempt to solve the problem of generic relational patterns, that is, those expressive patterns that have high recall while suffering low precision, as they subsume a large set of instances. Pantel et al. [17] proposed a similar, highly scalable approach, based on an edit-distance technique, to learn lexicoPOS patterns, showing both good performances and efficiency. Recently, Pantel and Ravichandran [16] extended this approach by making use of all syntactic dependency features for each noun. Systems We compare the results of Espresso with the following two state of the art extraction systems: Âƒ RH02: This algorithm by Ravichandran and Hovy [20] learns lexical extraction patterns from a set of seed instances of a particular relation (see Section 2.)

News article headlines are a rich source of paraphrases; they tend to describe the same event in various different ways, and can easily be obtained from the web. We compare two methods of aligning headlines to construct such an aligned corpus of paraphrases, one based on clustering, and the other on pairwise similarity-based matching. In the study described in this paper, we make an effort to collect Dutch paraphrases from news article headlines in an unsupervised way to be used in future paraphrase generation. News article headlines are abundant on the web, and are already grouped by news aggregators such as Google News. Crawling such news aggregators is an effective way of collecting related articles which can straightforwardly be used for the acquisition of paraphrases (Dolan et al., 2004; Nelken and Shieber, 2006). Where previous work has focused on aligning news-items at the paragraph and sentence level (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003), we choose to focus on aligning the headlines of news articles. 2.1 Clustering. For each original cluster, k-means clustering is then performed using the k found by the cluster stopping function. Using headlines of news articles clustered by Google News, and finding good paraphrases within these clusters is an effective route for obtaining pairs of paraphrased sentences with reasonable precision. We have shown that a cosine similarity function comparing headlines and using a back off strategy to compare context can be used to extract paraphrase pairs at a precision of 0.76.

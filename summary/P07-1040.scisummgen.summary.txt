Recently, confusion network decoding has been applied in machine translation system combination. This paper describes an improved confusion network based method to combine outputs from multiple MT systems. Recently, confusion network decoding for MT system combination has been proposed (Bangalore et al., 2001). In (Bangalore et al., 2001), Levenshtein alignment was used to generate the network. A modified Levenshtein alignment allowing shifts as in computation of the translation edit rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006) was used to align hy Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics, pages 312â€“319, Prague, Czech Republic, June 2007. Qc 2007 Association for Computational Linguistics potheses in (Sim et al., 2007). Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) was used to choose the skeleton in (Sim et al., 2007). This work was extended in (Rosti et al., 2007) by introducing system weights for word confidences. In (Rosti et al., 2007), simple score was assigned to the word coming from the th- best hypothesis. In (Rosti et al., 2007), the total confidence of the th best confusion network hypothesis , including NULL words, given the th source sentence was given by (5) word-level decoding. The improved system combination method was compared to a simple confusion network decoding without system weights and the method proposed in (Rosti et al., 2007) on the Arabic to English and Chinese to English NIST MT05 tasks. Compared to the baseline from (Rosti et al., 2007), the new method improves the BLEU scores significantly.

The core of the approach is a novel decoder based on lattice parsing with quasi- synchronous grammar (Smith and Eisner, 2006), a syntactic formalism that does not require source and target trees to be isomorphic. Decoding as QG parsing (§3–4): We present anovel decoder based on lattice parsing with quasi synchronous grammar (QG; Smith and Eisner, 2006).2 Further, we exploit generic approximate inference techniques to incorporate arbitrary “non- local” features in the dynamic programming algorithm (Chiang, 2007; Gimpel and Smith, 2009).Parameter estimation (§5): We exploit simi lar approximate inference methods in regularized pseudolikelihood estimation (Besag, 1975) with hidden variables to discriminatively and efficiently train our model. We compare lexical phrase and dependency syntax features, as well as a novel com 2 To date, QG has been used for word alignment (Smith and Eisner, 2006), adaptation and projection in parsing (Smith and Eisner, 2009), and various monolingual recognition and scoring tasks (Wang et al., 2007; Das and Smith, 2009); this paper represents its first application to MT. 219 Proceedings of the 2009 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 219–228, Singapore, 67 August 2009. Grammars A quasi-synchronous dependency grammar (QDG; Smith and Eisner, 2006) specifies a conditional model p(t, τt, a | s, τs).

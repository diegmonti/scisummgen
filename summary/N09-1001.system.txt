We propose a semi-supervised minimum cut framework that makes use of both WordNet definitions and its relation structure. This is important as the problem of subjectivity-ambiguity is frequent: We (Su and Markert, 2008) find that over 30% of words in our dataset are subjectivity-ambiguous. Qc 2009 Association for Computational Linguistics We propose a semi-supervised approach based on minimum cut in a lexical relation graph to assign subjectivity (subjective/objective) labels to word senses.2 Our algorithm outperforms supervised minimum cuts and standard supervised, non-graph classification algorithms (like SVM), reducing the error rate by up to 40%. Section 3 describes our proposed semi-supervised minimum cut framework in detail. There has been a large and diverse body of research in opinion mining, with most research at the text (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Ounis et al., 2006), sentence (Kim and Hovy, 2005; Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004; Riloff et al., 2003; Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003) or word (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Turney and Littman, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Takamura et al., 2005; Andreevskaia and Bergler, 2006; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007) level. However, in Su and Markert (2008a) as well as Wiebe and Mi- halcea (2006) we find that human can assign the binary distinction to word senses with a high level of reliability. Both Wiebe and Mihalcea (2006) and our prior work (Su and Markert, 2008) present an annotation scheme for word sense subjectivity and algorithms for automatic classification.

Intuitively, with the appropriate treatment of MWEs, the results of an Information Retrieval (IR) system could be improved. The aim of this paper is to apply techniques for the automatic extraction of MWEs from corpora to index them as a single unit. Experimental results show improvements on the retrieval of relevant documents when identifying MWEs and treating them as a single indexing unit. One of the motivations of this work is to investigate if the identification and appropriate treatment of Multiword Expressions (MWEs) in an application contributes to improve results and ultimately lead to more precise man-machine interaction. In this paper, we perform an application-oriented evaluation of the inclusion of MWE treatment into an Information Retrieval (IR) system. For example, if the query was pop star meaning celebrity, and the terms were indexed individually, the relevant documents may not be retrieved and the system would 101 Proceedings of the Workshop on Multiword Expressions: from Parsing and Generation to the Real World (MWE 2011), pages 101â€“109, Portland, Oregon, USA, 23 June 2011. Based on the hypothesis that the MWEs can improve the results of IR systems, we carried out an evaluation experiment. This work consists in investigating the impact of Multiword Expressions on applications, focusing on compound nouns in Information Retrieval systems, and whether a more adequate treatment for these expressions can bring possible improvements in the indexing these expressions.

The proportion of related pairwise words is calculated between adjacent windows of text to determine their lexical similarity. The lexical cohesion relations of reiteration and collocation are used to identify related words. These relations are automatically located using a combination of three linguistic features: word repetition, collocation and relation weights. Segmenting such data into distinct topics is useful for information retrieval, where only those segments relevant to a user's query can be retrieved. Another approach to text segmentation is the detection of semantically related words. Another approach extracted semantic information from Roget's Thesaurus (RT). Lexical cohesion relations (Halliday and Hasan, 1976) between words were identified in RT and used to construct lexical chains of related words in five texts (Morris and Hirst, 1991 ). In previous work, it was found that collocation (a lexical cohesion relation) was under-represented in the thesaurus. Following Morris and Hirst's work, a segmentation algorithm was developed based on identifying lexical cohesion relations across a text. This algorithm utilises linguistic features additional to those captured in the thesaurus to identify the other types of lexical cohesion relations that can exist in text. Lexical cohesion is expressed through the vocabulary used in text and the semantic relations between those words. To automatically detect lexical cohesion tics between pairwise words, three linguistic features were considered: word repetition, collocation and relation weights. These types can be identified using relation weights (Jobbins and Evett, 1998).
